# Questionnaire: JavaScript

## What is JavaScript?



javaScript is a ***high level***, ***object-oriented***, ***multi-paradigm*** programming language.

```
High level programming language means that it enables development of a program in a much more user-friendly programming context and is generally independent of the computer's hardware architecture.

Object-oriented or to be more precise, JavaScript is a prototype based object oriented language, which means it doesn't have classes rather it define behaviors using constructor function and then reuse it using the prototype.

Multi-paradigm means it is supporting more than one programming paradigm, in order to allow the most suitable programming style for a task. In other words, it allows you to use different styles of programing.

- JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.
- The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
- Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.




## Why is it called JavaScript? 

When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: “LiveScript”. But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a “younger brother” of Java would help.

But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language with its own specification called ECMAScript, and now it has no relation to Java at all.

## What is JavaScript engine?

A **JavaScript engine** is a software component that executes JavaScript code. The first JavaScript engines were mere interpreters, but all relevant modern engines use just-in-time compilation for improved performance.

JavaScript engines are typically developed by web browser vendors, and every major browser has one. In a browser, the JavaScript engine runs in concert with the rendering engine via the Document Object Model.

The use of JavaScript engines is not limited to browsers. For example, the V8 engine is a core component of the Node.js and Deno runtime systems.

Since ECMAScript is the standardized specification of JavaScript, ECMAScript engine is another name for these engines. With the advent of WebAssembly, some engines can also execute this code in the same sandbox as regular JavaScript code.


## How do engines work?

1. The engine (embedded if it’s a browser) reads (“parses”) the script.
2. Converts (“compiles”) the script to the machine language.
3. The machine code runs.


The engine applies optimizations at each step of the process. It even watches the compiled script as it runs, analyzes the data that flows through it, and further optimizes the machine code based on that knowledge.

## Whats is Node.js

*Node.js* is a JavaScript ***runtime environment***.

## What Does Runtime Environment (RTE) Mean?
The runtime environment is the environment in which a program or application is executed. It's the hardware and software infrastructure that supports the running of a particular codebase in real time.

Because so much of the final outcome is determined by the runtime environment, experts often consider the runtime environment to be vitally important in figuring out how to use a piece of software. In a very fundamental sense, resources have to be allocated correctly in order for a runtime environment to be successful.

The right relationships have to be set up to allow program and multithread processing, and the program has to be able to correctly access the assets it needs to run.


## What is Node JS in simple terms?
Node. js (Node) is an open source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side. Node is useful for developing applications that require a persistent connection from the browser to the server and is often used for real-time applications such as chat, news feeds and web push notifications.
